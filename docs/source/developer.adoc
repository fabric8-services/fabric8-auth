This is the developer documentation for fabric8-auth. It is useful if you wish to contribute to the fabric8-auth project in some way.

== Source code

The latest source code for fabric8-auth can be found at GitHub link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth[here].  The repository is configured to perform automatic, continual releases from the *master* branch any time a new pull request is merged.

== Issue Tracking

link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth/issues[GitHub issues] are used for tracking the development of new features and service issues.

== Development workflow

Basically, all work done to the fabric8-auth code base must have a corresponding issue, whether it be a complex new feature, major or minor bug or simply correcting a typo in the code, readme file or documentation.  This allows the project team to carefully manage and audit the changes made to such a critical piece of the fabric8 platform.  If you wish to contribute any code or other changes to the project, here are the steps to follow:

. Pick an existing issue to work with (or create a new one)
. Fork the fabric8-auth repository to your own GitHub account
. Check out the forked repository in your development environment
. Create a new branch representing the issue you will work on (*git checkout -b ISSUE-XXX*)
. Make your changes, commit them to the issue branch
. Push the changes to your forked repository
. In Github, browse to the issue branch in your forked repository
. Create a pull request for your issue branch, making sure to clearly link the issue that the PR is for
. Update the issue with a link to the pull request

[width="90%",cols="20,70"]
|============================
|build                 |
Compiles sources into executable binary
|dev                   |
Same as build, however also starts up a Docker instance of the Postgres database and runs the auth service on the host.
|deploy-auth-openshift |
Starts a minishift instance and deploys the "latest" tagged versions of the fabric-auth service, plus a postgres database from the docker.io repository, exposing the service at http://minishift.local:31000.
|dev-db-openshift      |
Starts a minishift instance and deploys a postgres database to it, while building and running the fabric8-auth service on the host machine which then connects to the db on port 31001.
|dev-openshift         |
Starts a minishift instance and deploys a postgres database to it, then builds and deploys the fabric-auth service to minishift also, exposing the service at http://minishift.local:31000.
|clean-openshift       |
Removes the deployment from minishift, deleting the deployments and removing the project.
|docs                  |
Builds the documentation in the /docs directory.

== Service Accounts

Service accounts are used by other services to allow secure service-to-service interaction.  One example of this is the auth service's protection API, which requires a PAT (Protection API Token) in order for the resource servers to register newly created resources, and query the access rights for clients attempting to access resources that they don't own.

Service account configuration is expected to be found in */etc/fabric8/service-account-secrets.conf*, in JSON format.  Here's an example configuration:

[source,json]
{
    "accounts": [
        {
            "name":"fabric8-wit",
            "id":"5dec5fdb-09e3-4453-b73f-5c828832b28e",
            "secrets":["$2a$04$nI7z7Re4pbx.V5vwm14n5.velhB.nbMgxdZ0vSomWVxcct34zbH9e"]
        },
        {
            "name":"fabric8-tenant",
            "id":"c211f1bd-17a7-4f8c-9f80-0917d167889d",
            "secrets":["$2a$04$ynqM/syKMYowMIn5cyqHuevWnfzIQqtyY4m.61B02qltY5SOyGIOe", "$2a$04$sbC/AfW2c33hv8orGA.1D.LXa/.IY76VWhsfqxCVhrhFkDfL0/XGK"]
        },
        {
            "name":"fabric8-jenkins-idler",
            "id":"341c283f-0cd7-48a8-9281-4583aceb3617",
            "secrets":["$2a$04$hbGHAVKohpeDgHzafnLwdO4ZzhEn9ukVP/6CaOtf5o3Btp.r6tXTG"]
        }
    ]
}

At deployment time this configuration file is provided by the container, via a pre-configured secret (see the reference docs for details). The configuration file is loaded in */configuration/configuration.go* as part of the call to *NewConfigurationData*.

This method loads the service account configuration and stores it in the *ConfigurationData.sa* type variable.  

The path of the configuration file can be overridden by either setting a command line parameter (*serviceAccountConfig*) or setting an environment variable (*AUTH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONFIG_FILE*) to point to a new file location (see the *main()* function in */main.go*).

__Authentication__

Service account authentication is handled by the `Exchange` function in `/controller/token.go`:

[source]
func (c *TokenController) Exchange(ctx *app.ExchangeTokenContext) error {
