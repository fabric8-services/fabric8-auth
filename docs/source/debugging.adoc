This section shows how to install a Go debugger
(link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve:[delve]) and how to actually do some
debugging from a terminal.

For somebody coming from a C/C++ background this should feed very familiar as
the GNU Debugger or GDB command line interface has similar commands.
The following table illustrates just a few of the similarities.

.Small comparison between GNU Debugger (gdb) and Go Debugger (dlv) commands
|===
|Function | GNU Debugger | Go debugger (dlv)

|Connect to a running program
|`gdb attach <PID>`
|`dlv attach <PID>`

|Set a breakpoint
|`gdb break <function>`
|`dlv break <package>.<function>`

|Continue after hitting a breakpoint or attaching to a program
|`gdb continue`
|`dlv continue`

|Show a backtrace for the current location
|`gdb bt`
|`dlv bt`

== Install debugger

Install the link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve:[delve] debugger by running:

----
$ go get github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv
----

This will create the file `$GOPATH/bin/dlv` so in order to run the `dlv`
executable from anywhere, make sure you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`.

link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation:[Here]
are instructions to install delve on different platforms.

== Example debugging

In this example we'll debug a running Auth server using delve and set a breakpoint
on the function `WorkitemController.Show`.

NOTE: To see other ways to run `dlv`, see the link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv.md#dlv[usage page].

Let's assume the binary `./bin/auth` is running.

=== Attach to program

To link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv_attach.md#dlv-attach[*attach*]
the debugger to your running fabric8-auth server,run:

----
$ dlv attach $(pidof ./bin/auth)
----

The will bring you into the delve shell which looks like this:

----
Type 'help' for list of commands.
(dlv)
----

The `./bin/auth` program is *paused* right now. Once we've set a breakpoint we will
let it run again.

=== Set breakpoint

Now, set the link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#break[*breakpoint*]
on the on the `WorkitemController.Show` function that is defined in `workitem.go`:

----
(dlv) break WorkitemController.Show
----

As mentioned before the fabric8-auth server is paused and we need to bring it
back into a *run* state. To do this, we let the program
link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#continue[*continue*]:

----
(dlv) continue
----

=== Trigger breakpoint

Open another shell and fetch an existing workitem using curl:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/workitems/1
----

(Replace the `1` with an existing workitem ID if needed)

Now, your debugger shell show something like this:

----
> main.(*WorkitemController).Show() /tmp/go/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth/workitem.go:30 (hits goroutine(11):1 total:3) (PC: 0x405633)
(dlv)
----

The program is *paused* again for you to inspect it and the curl command
has not returned yet.

=== Backtrace

To show a link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#stack[backtrace] of how we got here in terms of stack frames, run:

----
(dlv) bt
----

The output might look similar to this but it can change over time and as
development goes on:

----

The first incrementing number on every second line stands for the number of the
stackframe. Stackframe *0* is one where we set the breakpoint earlier.

=== Continue with normal processing

While there are many interesting ways to inspect your program using the *delve*
debugger, we will instead let our program *continue* to run and thereby proceed
with delivering the workitem to the curl command.

----
(dlv) continue
----

Check the shell in which you ran the curl command to see if you have go a result.

=== Exit debugging

To exit the debugger you can use the link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#exit[`exit`]
command or press kbd:[Ctrl+d], just like you would exit any Bash for example:

----
(dlv) exit
Would you like to kill the process? [Y/n] y
----

You are being asked if you want to kill the process and the answer to this
question very much depends on the way you've started *delve*. If you've attached
to a running process like we did, the answer to this question is probably *no*.
And if you've just started the program under test for debugging purposes then
you might as well answer y to stop it.
