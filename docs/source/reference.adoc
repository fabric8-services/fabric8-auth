This is the Reference documentation for fabric8-auth. You may find it useful if you wish to deploy and configure the service, or to interact
with its authentication and authorization services via its REST endpoints.  If you wish to understand more about the inner workings of fabric8-auth and be
able to build and/or develop the project, please refer to the link:developer.html[Developer documentation] instead.

== Service Accounts

Service accounts are used to authenticate resource servers in order for them to interact with the fabric8-auth permission (and other) endpoints.

Credentials for service accounts are stored in Openshift using link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets], 
which enable the credentials to be stored outside of the project source code and only made available to fabric8-auth at runtime.

The service account credentials are defined in a JSON document, with each account having the following attributes:

* *name* This field is used to describe the account, and has no bearing on authentication logic
* *id* The unique identifier of the service account
* *secrets* An array of credential values.  Use of an array allows new credentials to be added while retaining older credentials.  This strategy allows
for a smoother deployment process, eliminating the need to "juggle" the deployment of various services in order to ensure synchronized credentials between
systems.  Simply add a new credential value, and then only remove expired credentials at a later time once all dependent services have been updated to use 
the new value.

=== Adding a service account

When defining secrets for service account credentials, start by creating a JSON document with the account name, id and secrets values:

[source,json]
{
  "accounts": [
      {
          "name":"fabric8-wit",
          "id":"5dec5fdb-09e3-4453-b73f-5c828832b28e",
          "secrets":["witsecret"]
      },
      {
          "name":"fabric8-tenant",
          "id":"c211f1bd-17a7-4f8c-9f80-0917d167889d",
          "secrets":["tenantsecretOld", "tenantsecretNew"]
      }
  ]
}

Next, convert the entire document to a base64 value, this will be used in the secrets configuration:

[source,base64]
ewogICJhY2NvdW50cyI6IFsKICAgICAgewogICAgICAgICAgIm5hbWUiOiJmYWJyaWM4LXdpdCIsCiAgICAgICAgICAiaWQiOiI1ZGVjNWZkYi0wOWUzLTQ0NTMtYjczZi01YzgyODgzMmIyOGUiLAogICAgICAgICAgInNlY3JldHMiOlsid2l0c2VjcmV0Il0KICAgICAgfSwKICAgICAgewogICAgICAgICAgIm5hbWUiOiJmYWJyaWM4LXRlbmFudCIsCiAgICAgICAgICAiaWQiOiJjMjExZjFiZC0xN2E3LTRmOGMtOWY4MC0wOTE3ZDE2Nzg4OWQiLAogICAgICAgICAgInNlY3JldHMiOlsidGVuYW50c2VjcmV0T2xkIiwgInRlbmFudHNlY3JldE5ldyJdCiAgICAgIH0KICBdCn0=  

This value should then be placed into a JSON document in a new file which will contain the secrets configuration - in this example we use the name *fabric8-auth-service-accounts* for the secret, which will be used in the next step to reference this secret value.  You can call this file anything, but let's assume it's called *service-account-secrets.json*.  Also make sure you modify the namespace value to suit your environment:

[source,json]
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "Secret",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "fabric8-auth-service-accounts"
  },
  "namespace": "developer",
  "data": { 
    "service-account-secrets": "ewogICJhY2NvdW50cyI6IFsKICAgICAgewogICAgICAgICAgIm5hbWUiOiJmYWJyaWM4LXdpdCIsCiAgICAgICAgICAiaWQiOiI1ZGVjNWZkYi0wOWUzLTQ0NTMtYjczZi01YzgyODgzMmIyOGUiLAogICAgICAgICAgInNlY3JldHMiOlsid2l0c2VjcmV0Il0KICAgICAgfSwKICAgICAgewogICAgICAgICAgIm5hbWUiOiJmYWJyaWM4LXRlbmFudCIsCiAgICAgICAgICAiaWQiOiJjMjExZjFiZC0xN2E3LTRmOGMtOWY4MC0wOTE3ZDE2Nzg4OWQiLAogICAgICAgICAgInNlY3JldHMiOlsidGVuYW50c2VjcmV0T2xkIiwgInRlbmFudHNlY3JldE5ldyJdCiAgICAgIH0KICBdCn0="
    }
}

You can use the OpenShift command line client to create the secret value:

[source]
shane@shane-ThinkPad-W541:~$ oc create -f service-account-secrets.json
secret "fabric8-auth-service-accounts" created

After the secret is created, its value must be mounted as a file in the fabric8-auth deployment's file system so that fabric8-auth can read the service account configuration.  This is done in two steps; first we add a volume with the *secretName* set to the name of our secret.  Secondly, we mount that volume in a specific path so that our secret value will be exposed to the fabric8-auth service as a file.

[IMPORTANT]
The secret value must be mounted as */etc/fabric8/service-account-secrets.conf*

Here is an example configuration snippet:

[literal]
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/fabric8/
            name: auth-serviceaccounts
            readOnly: true
        volumes:
        - name: auth-serviceaccounts
          secret:
            secretName: fabric8-auth-service-accounts
            items:
            - key: service-account-secrets
              path: service-account-secrets.conf
