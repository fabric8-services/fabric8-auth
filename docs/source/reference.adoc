This is the Reference documentation for fabric8-auth.

== Service Accounts

Service accounts are used to authenticate resource servers in order for them to interact with the fabric8-auth permission endpoints.

Credentials for service accounts are stored in Openshift using link:https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets], 
which enable the credentials to be stored outside of the project source code and only available after deployment.
