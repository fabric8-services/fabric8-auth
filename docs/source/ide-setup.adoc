== Visual Studio Code [[vscode]]

=== Installation [[vscodeinstallation]]

Download and install the appropriate distribution of Visual Studio Code from link:https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Studio Code Download site]

=== Configuration [[vscodeconfiguration]]

. Ensure your `GOPATH` environment variable is correctly set.
. Install `gometalinter`
.. Run `go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter` in your terminal
.. Run `gometalinter --install`
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are on Windows, `gometalinter --install` may fail. with a lot of erros about `cannot find package`. If this happens, use the File Explorer to navigate to the `src/github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/vendor`. Delete the `src` file, and create a new folder called `src`. Copy the other folders in the `vendor` folder in to the `src` folder. Rerun `gometalinter --install` in the terminal window.
====
. Launch Visual Studio Code from a location where your `GOPATH` is correctly set. We recommend changing to the `src\github.com\fabric8-services\fabric8-auth` directory, and executing `code .` which will launch VS Code, with the FABRIC8-WIT project open.
. Open any `.go` file by clicking on it. An info dialog box will open at the top of the screen. Click on _Show Recommendations_ and click on the green _Install_ button next to the _Go_ extension from `lukehoban`.
. Click the blue _Enable_ button, and then ok to restart Visual Studio Code.
. On restart, you will notice that a Yellow  _Analysis Tools Missing_ warning appears in the status bar. Click it, and then click /Install/ to install the Go tools that Visual Studio Code calls out to in order to provide actions such as refactoring, autocomplete etc.
