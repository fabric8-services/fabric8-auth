== Building from source [[building]]

The following guide is mainly targeted towards a Linux or Mac OSX development
machine. If you are on Windows, we recommend to take a look at
link:docs/development/getting-started-win.adoc[Getting started with fabric8-auth development on Windows].

=== Prerequisites [[prerequisites]]

You need to install:

* `go` (>= v1.7)
* `git`
* `mercurial`
* `make`

==== Check your Go version [[check-go-version]]

Run the following command to find out your Go version.

----
$ go version
----

*You must at least have Go version 1.7.*

See <<fetch-dependencies>> to see an explanaition on how we deal with
dependencies.

==== Install glide [[glide-setup]]

This project uses link:https://glide.sh/[glide] as a package manager for Go.

To install glide, go to the
link:https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases[release page] and download
the newest binary for your operating system.

Unpack the archive that you've downloaded and place the `glide` executable
somewhere so that it is in your `PATH`.

To check if everything is working, type `glide --version` in a terminal.

----
$ glide --version
glide version v0.11.0
----

Try to use at least version `0.11.0` as we haven't tested another version.

=== Get the code [[get-the-code]]

Assuming you have Go installed and configured (have `$GOPATH` setup) here is
how to build.

Check out the code

----
$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
----

=== Build [[build]]

Like most other projects, this one depends on various other projects that need
to be downloaded.

We also generate some code from design files that shall make it into our
final artifacts.

To fetch the dependencies, generate code and finally build the project you can
type `make` in a freshly clone repository of this project.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make
----
If you are getting the following error
----
[ERROR]	Failed to set references: Unable to update checked out version (Skip to cleanup)
make: *** [vendor] Error 1
----
Try out this
----
$ glide cache-clear
$ make clean deps
$ make build
----

==== Special make targets

There is no need to fetch the dependencies, or re-generate code every time you
want to compile. That's why we offer special `make` targets for these topics:

 * <<fetch-dependencies>>
 * <<generate-code>>
 * <<build>>
 * <<clean>>
 * <<test>>
 * <<coverage>>

===== Fetch dependencies [[fetch-dependencies]]

This will download all the dependencies for this project inside a directory
called `vendor`. This way we can ensure that every developer and our CI system
is using the same version.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make deps
----

For dependency management of `go` packages we use `glide`.
The file `glide.yaml` contains all dependencies.
It is not suggested that you edit the file by hand but if you want to
understand the format for this file, look link:https://glide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glide.yaml/[here].

===== Generate GOA sources [[generate-code]]

You need to run this command if you just checked out the code and later if
you've modified the designs.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make generate
----

===== Build [[build]]

If you want to just build the ALM server and client, run `make build`.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make build
----

===== Clean [[clean]]

This removes all downloaded dependencies, all generated code and compiled
artifacts.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make clean
----

===== Tests [[test]]

Here's how to run all available tests. All tests will check all Go packages
except those in the `vendor/` directory.
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose available.

Setting up test environment - `make integration-test-env-prepare`

Tear test environment down - `make integration-test-env-tear-down`

[horizontal]
unit-tests::
Unit tests have the minimum requirement on time and environment setup.
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make test-unit
----

integration-tests::
Integration tests demand more setup (i.e. the PostgreSQL DB must be already
running) and probably time. We recommend that you use `docker-compose up -d db`.
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make test-integration
----

all::
To run both, the unit and the integration tests you can run
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make test-all
----

===== Coverage [[coverage]]

To visualize the coverage of unit, integration, or all tests you can run these
commands:

 * `$ make coverage-unit`
 * `$ make coverage-integration`
 * `$ make coverage-all`

NOTE: If the tests (see <<test>>) have not yet run, or if the sources have changed
since the last time the tests ran, they will be re-run to produce up to date
coverage profiles.

Each of the above tests (see <<test>>) produces a coverage profile by default.
Those coverage files are available under

----
tmp/coverage/<package>/coverage.<test>.mode-<mode>
----

Here's how the <placeholders> expand

[horizontal]
`<package>`::
something like `github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth/models`

`<test>`::
`unit` or `integration`

`<mode>`::
Sets the mode for coverage analysis for the packages being tested.
Possible values for `<mode>` are *set* (the default), *count*, or *atomic* and
they directly relate to the output of `go test --help`.
 * *set*: bool: does this statement run?
 * *count*: int: how many times does this statement run?
 * *atomic*: int: count, but correct in multithreaded tests; significantly more
   expensive.

In addition to all individual coverage information for each package, we also
create three more files:

[horizontal]
`tmp/coverage.unit.mode-<mode>`::
This file collects all the coverage profiles for all *unit* tests.

`tmp/coverage.integration.mode-<mode>`::
This file collects all the coverage profiles for all *integration* tests.

`tmp/coverage.mode-<mode>`::
This file is the merge result of the two afore mentioned files and thus gives
coverage information for all tests.

== Configuration file

If no configuration file is specified when the auth is started, these are the defaults.

[source,yaml]
.config.yaml

# Github OAuth2 configuration
# ----------------------------

github.client.id : 875da0d2113ba0a6951d
github.secret : 2fe6736e90a9283036a37059d75ac0c82f4f5288

----

Although this is a YAML file, we highly suggest to stick to this rather lenghty notation instead of nesting structs.

To override configuration values using environment variables, use the prefix
`AUTH_` and replace the dots in the variables names with underscores.

For example to override `postgres.password`, set the environment variable `AUTH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to the value of you liking.

NOTE: Environment variables override the default values and the ones you've set in your config file.

==== Development

Only files `+./*.go+`, `+./design/*.go+`, `+./models/*.go+` and `+./tool/wit-cli/main.go+` should be edited.

These files and directory are generated:

 * `./app/`
 * `./assets/js/`
 * `./client/`
 * `./swagger/`
 * `./tool/cli/`
 * `./bindata_asstfs.go`

== Developer setup

Start up dependent docker services using `docker-compose` and runs auto reload on source change tool `fresh`.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-auth
$ make dev
----

The above steps start the API Server on port 8089.

Test out the build by executing CLI commands in a different terminal.

NOTE: The CLI needs the API Server which was started on executing `make dev`  to be up and running. Please do not kill the process. Alternatively if you haven't run `make dev` you could just start the server by running `./bin/alm`.

Generate a token for future use.
----
./bin/auth-cli generate token -H localhost:8089 --pp
----

You should get Token in response, save this token in your favourite editor as you need to use this token for POST API calls


== Rapid development on Minikube / Minishift

If you run fabric8 in minikube or minishift then you can get rapid feedback of your code via the following:

on openshift:
 * oc edit dc auth
on kubernetes:
 * kubectl edit deploy auth

* replace the `fabric8/auth:xxxx` image with `fabric8/auth:dev` and save

Now when developing you can:

* use the `kube-redeploy` make target whenever you want to create a new docker image and redeploy
```
make kube-redeploy
```
if the docker build fails you may need to type this first to point your local shell at the docker daemon inside minishift/minikube:
```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
or
eval $(minikube docker-env)

```
